# Pokemon-Stats-Analysis

## What is this?

An analysis of the stats and data of 721 different Pokemon using a Jupyter Notebook. My goal is to find the top 10 best non-legendary Pokemon and the top 5 legendary Pokemon based on pure stats, while practicing pandas and seaborn in the process.

## What libraries are used?

Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
